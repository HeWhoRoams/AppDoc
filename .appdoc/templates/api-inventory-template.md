# API Inventory

## Executive Summary

This document catalogs all API endpoints exposed by the system, including their HTTP methods, parameters, authentication requirements, and response formats. It serves as the primary reference for developers integrating with or consuming this API, and provides essential information for testing, monitoring, and troubleshooting API interactions.

## Overview

Describe the purpose and scope of the API inventory for this codebase.

## API Endpoints

| Name | Path | Method | Description | Parameters | Return Type | Status Codes | Auth Required |
|------|------|--------|-------------|------------|------------|--------------|---------------|

_No API endpoints detected. This codebase may not expose HTTP APIs, or uses patterns not yet recognized by the scanner._

## Data Models

List and describe all data models referenced by the API endpoints.

_No data models detected. See the Data Model Catalog for a complete inventory of data structures._

## Authentication & Security

Describe authentication requirements and security measures for each endpoint.

_No explicit authentication patterns detected. Review endpoint implementations for authorization logic._

## Error Responses

Document common error responses and status codes across endpoints.

_No standardized error responses documented. Refer to individual endpoint implementations._

## API Versioning

Describe versioning strategy and current API versions.

_No explicit API versioning detected. Endpoints may be unversioned or use implicit versioning._

## Usage Examples

Provide example requests and responses for key endpoints.

_No example requests/responses available. Refer to endpoint documentation or integration tests._

## Dependencies

List external services or APIs that this API depends on.

_No external API dependencies detected. System may be self-contained or dependencies not yet documented._

## Population Guide

**Intent**: This template captures all API endpoints, data models, and usage patterns exposed by the codebase to provide a comprehensive reference for developers integrating with the system.

**Key Indicators to Parse**:
- **Endpoint Discovery**: Scan source files for route decorators/attributes (e.g., `@app.route`, `[HttpGet]`, `app.get`), controller classes, and API definition files (OpenAPI/Swagger specs)
- **Method Analysis**: Identify HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) and map to business operations
- **Parameter Extraction**: Parse method signatures, query parameters, request bodies, and path variables from function definitions
- **Return Type Mapping**: Analyze return statements, response models, and status codes from implementation
- **Authentication Patterns**: Look for middleware, decorators, or guards indicating auth requirements (JWT, OAuth, API keys)
- **Security Measures**: Identify HTTPS requirements, rate limiting, CORS policies, and input validation
- **Error Handling**: Parse exception handlers and error response definitions
- **Versioning**: Look for version prefixes in routes or API versioning decorators

**Framework-Specific Parsing**:
- **Express.js**: Parse `app.get/post/put/delete` calls and middleware chains
- **ASP.NET**: Analyze `[HttpGet]`, `[Authorize]` attributes and controller routing
- **Spring Boot**: Examine `@RequestMapping`, `@RestController` annotations
- **Flask**: Look for `@app.route` decorators and error handlers
- **FastAPI**: Parse route decorators, dependency injection, and response models

**Robust Population Rules**:
- Include only public/external APIs, exclude internal/private methods
- Group endpoints by functional area or controller
- Document error responses and status codes
- Provide realistic example payloads based on data model structures
- Note deprecated endpoints and migration paths
- Cross-reference with data models section for consistency
- Include API dependencies and external integrations
- Document versioning strategy and current versions

**Accuracy Checks**:
- Verify all endpoints are actually implemented in code
- Ensure parameter types match method signatures
- Validate example requests/responses against schemas
- Confirm authentication requirements are correctly identified
- Test error responses match implementation
- Validate versioning is consistent across endpoints
