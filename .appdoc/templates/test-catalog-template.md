# Test Catalog

## Executive Summary

This document catalogs all test suites, test cases, and testing infrastructure for the system. It provides visibility into test coverage, identifies testing gaps, and guides developers in maintaining and expanding test coverage. Use this to understand testing scope, run specific test suites, or assess the impact of code changes on existing tests.

## Overview

Describe the testing strategy and coverage for this codebase.

## Test Environment Setup

Document how to set up the testing environment and required dependencies.

_No test environment setup detected. Refer to testing framework documentation._

## Test Suites

| Suite Name | Type | Purpose | Coverage Target | Key Scenarios | Execution Time |
|------------|------|--------|----------------|--------------|----------------|

_No test suites detected. Check for test files and testing framework configuration._

## Test Coverage Metrics

Document current test coverage metrics and targets.

_No coverage metrics available. Run coverage tools to generate coverage reports._

## Test Cases

| Case Name | Suite | Input | Expected Output | Description | Priority |
|-----------|-------|------|----------------|-------------|----------|

_No test cases detected. Refer to test files for individual test implementations._

## Test Maintenance

Describe how tests are maintained, updated, and monitored for effectiveness.

_No test maintenance process documented. Establish testing standards and review processes._

## Example Test Runs

Provide example test run outputs or logs.

_No example test runs available. Execute tests and review output logs._

## Population Guide

**Intent**: This template documents the testing approach and coverage to ensure code quality, facilitate maintenance, and guide future development.

**Key Indicators to Parse**:
- **Test File Discovery**: Scan for test directories, files ending in .test.js, .spec.ts, Test.java, etc.
- **Test Framework Identification**: Analyze package.json, build files for testing frameworks (Jest, JUnit, pytest)
- **Coverage Configuration**: Review coverage tools and thresholds in configuration files
- **Test Categories**: Identify unit, integration, e2e, performance, and other test types
- **Test Scenarios**: Parse test method names and descriptions for covered functionality
- **Test Data**: Identify test fixtures, mocks, and data setup patterns
- **CI/CD Integration**: Analyze test execution in build pipelines and automation

**Framework-Specific Parsing**:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Parse Jest, Mocha, Jasmine test files and configuration
- **Python**: Analyze pytest, unittest files and test discovery patterns
- **Java**: Examine JUnit, TestNG test classes and annotations
- **.NET**: Parse xUnit, NUnit test methods and attributes
- **Go**: Look for testing package usage and test file conventions

**Robust Population Rules**:
- Document all test suites with their scope, type, and purpose
- Include coverage metrics and targets for different test types
- List critical test cases that validate core functionality
- Provide examples of test execution and output interpretation
- Note any testing gaps or areas needing more coverage
- Include performance and load testing if applicable
- Document test environment setup and dependencies
- Describe test maintenance practices and monitoring
- Include CI/CD integration and automated test execution

**Accuracy Checks**:
- Verify test files exist and are executable
- Run tests to confirm they pass and produce expected output
- Validate coverage reports match documented metrics
- Ensure test cases align with actual code functionality
- Confirm testing tools and frameworks are correctly identified
- Test environment setup instructions on clean environments
- Verify CI/CD integration works as documented
