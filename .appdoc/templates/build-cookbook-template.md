# Build Cookbook

## Executive Summary

This document provides step-by-step instructions for building, testing, and deploying the system from source code. It includes all required dependencies, build commands, CI/CD integration details, and troubleshooting guidance. Use this to set up development environments, automate builds, or diagnose build failures.

## Overview

Describe the build process and automation for this codebase.

## Prerequisites

List system requirements and prerequisites for building the project.

_No prerequisites detected. Consult project README or setup documentation._

## Build Steps

| Step | Command | Description | Estimated Time |
|------|---------|-------------|----------------|

_No build steps detected. Check for package.json scripts, Makefile, or build configuration files._

## Dependencies

List all build dependencies and tools required.

| Dependency | Version | Purpose | Installation |
|------------|---------|---------|--------------|  

_No build dependencies detected. Refer to package.json, requirements.txt, or dependency manifests._## CI/CD Integration

Describe how the build process integrates with continuous integration and deployment.

_No CI/CD configuration detected. Check for .github/workflows, .gitlab-ci.yml, or Jenkins files._

## Troubleshooting

Common build issues and their solutions.

_No troubleshooting documentation available. Consult build logs and error messages._

## Example Build Scripts

Provide example build scripts or commands.

_No example build scripts available. Refer to project build configuration files._

## Population Guide

**Intent**: This template documents the complete build process to enable developers to build, test, and deploy the system consistently across different environments.

**Key Indicators to Parse**:
- **Build Script Analysis**: Examine package.json scripts, Makefile, build.gradle, pom.xml, and CI/CD pipelines
- **Dependency Declaration**: Parse package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile, and dependency management files
- **Build Tool Configuration**: Review webpack.config.js, tsconfig.json, and other build configuration files
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Analyze GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or other automation scripts
- **Environment Setup**: Look for Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml, and environment setup scripts
- **Prerequisites**: Identify required tools, versions, and system dependencies

**Framework-Specific Parsing**:
- **Node.js**: Parse package.json scripts, npm dependencies, and build tools like Webpack
- **Python**: Analyze setup.py, requirements.txt, and build tools like Poetry or setuptools
- **Java**: Examine pom.xml, build.gradle, and Maven/Gradle configurations
- **.NET**: Parse .csproj files, NuGet packages, and MSBuild configurations

**Robust Population Rules**:
- Document the complete build pipeline from source to deployable artifact
- Include all required tools, versions, and installation steps
- Specify build targets for different environments (dev, test, prod)
- Include any pre-build setup or post-build processing
- Document troubleshooting steps for common build failures
- Include CI/CD integration and automation scripts
- Note platform-specific requirements (OS, architecture)
- Provide performance benchmarks and optimization tips

**Accuracy Checks**:
- Verify all commands work on a clean environment
- Ensure dependency versions are current and compatible
- Test build scripts on different platforms if applicable
- Validate that examples produce expected outputs
- Confirm CI/CD integration works with documented steps
- Test prerequisites on different development environments
