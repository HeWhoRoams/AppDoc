# appdoc




## Overview

AppDoc provides automated documentation extraction, quality assessment, and improvement tools for codebases. The toolkit is implemented in PowerShell and outputs comprehensive reports and recommendations based on analysis of your codebase and generated documentation.

**Note:** The layout and content of external AI-generated samples were used only to inform improvements to AppDoc's templates and prompts. No external sample files are required or processed at runtime.

## Prerequisites

- **PowerShell 7+** (required for all scripts)
- **Windows OS** (tested)
- **Current documentation output** in `docs/`

## Required Files

To run the full documentation extraction and assessment workflow, ensure the following files exist:

- `.appdoc/scripts/powershell/analyze-capability-gaps.ps1` — Analyze documentation quality and identify gaps
- `.appdoc/scripts/powershell/generate-improvements.ps1` — Generate improvement suggestions
- `.appdoc/scripts/powershell/calculate-quality-metrics.ps1` — Compute quality metrics
- `.appdoc/scripts/powershell/synthesize-assessment-report.ps1` — Generate final assessment report
- `.appdoc/scripts/powershell/run-all-generators.ps1` — Run all documentation generators and assessment scripts
- `.appdoc/scripts/powershell/quality-framework.psm1` — Quality scoring functions
- `.appdoc/scripts/powershell/gap-analysis.psm1` — Gap analysis data structures

## Quick Start

1. **Prepare your codebase and documentation output:**
   - Ensure your generated documentation is in the `docs/` directory.

2. **Run the full assessment workflow:**

```powershell
# From the scripts directory:
cd .appdoc/scripts/powershell

# Run all generators and assessment (replace path as needed)
./run-all-generators.ps1 -RootPath ".." -IncludeAssessment
```

3. **View the assessment report:**
   - Open `specs/001-review-ai-samples/final-assessment-report.md` for results, gap analysis, and recommendations.

## Individual Script Usage

- **Analyze capability gaps:**
  ```powershell
  ./analyze-capability-gaps.ps1 -CurrentDocsDir "../../docs"
  ```
- **Generate improvements:**
  ```powershell
  ./generate-improvements.ps1
  ```
- **Synthesize report:**
  ```powershell
  ./synthesize-assessment-report.ps1 -OutputPath "../../specs/001-review-ai-samples/final-assessment-report.md"
  ```

## Output Files

- `specs/001-review-ai-samples/gap-analysis.json` — Capability gap analysis
- `specs/001-review-ai-samples/improvement-suggestions.json` — Recommendations
- `specs/001-review-ai-samples/quality-metrics.json` — Quality metrics
- `specs/001-review-ai-samples/final-assessment-report.md` — Final report

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all required scripts and modules are present in `.appdoc/scripts/powershell/`
- Use PowerShell 7+ for compatibility
- Check file paths for documentation output
- Review error messages for missing files or permissions
